Marshall-Starke Development Center's industrial division is designed to provide alternate employment/extended training for adults with disabilities. We provide individuals with sub-contract work to enhance their work skills in preparation for competitive work. Our workshop offers a work place that mirrors a community employment environment, while offering individuals who are not community job ready an opportunity to become wage earners.

### Real Products
Real Products, which manufactures plywood reels used by wire companies, was incorporated into our industrial services in 1996. We, as an Agency, wanted a business venture to produce additional revenue for programming and to provide employment opportunities for the people Marshall-Starke serves. Real Products has enabled us to provide an integrated work environment with disabled and non-disabled working side by side to produce a quality product.
