The purpose of this program is to place individuals with disabilities into gainful employment.

### The Process
A profile is completed for each individual to identify strengths, interests, and support needs. The Placement Consultant contacts local employers to locate and/or create positions that would be well matched to the interest and needs of the person. The Placement Consultant would then train the individual on the job, as well as offer education and advocacy with management and co-workers. Community Employment staff will provide support to the individual until the employer is satisfied with the employee's performance with the goal of long-term employment in mind.

### More Information

### History
