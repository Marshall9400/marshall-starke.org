Supported Living is a residential program that allows individuals with disabilities to live independently with support from Marshall-Starke staff. It offers a family the security of knowing that their disabled family member will live in an environment which provides opportunities for the acquisition, improvement, and retention of skills necessary to live successfully in their own home. Each person has an annual meeting where goals are set. Skill areas include domestic, safety, recreation/leisure, hygiene, self-help, and self-advocacy. Staff will provide as much assistance as each individual requires.

### Living Arrangements
Some individuals may live alone, but the majority of people do have housemates. The living arrangement is determined by the needs of the individual and also identifies the amount of staff time necessary to provide services. An individual may require a few hours a day or week or as much as 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

### Who Qualifies
This program serves individuals receiving Developmental Disability Medicaid Waiver Services. Applications must be made to Bureau of Developmental Disabilities. For more information on the application process, contact Marshall-Starke's Vice President of Adult Services.
