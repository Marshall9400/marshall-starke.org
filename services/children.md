Our children's programs promote the development of young children while providing support and encouragement for parents.

### Early Head Start
Early Head Start offers comprehensive developmental, health, and nutritional services for infants and toddlers 0-3 years of age combined with prenatal support for pregnant mothers and social service resource and referral for families.

### Head Start
Head Start serves children from three to five years of age providing an excellent preschool program to prepare children for entry into kindergarten coupled with services for parents to foster self sufficiency and resourcefulness.

Both programs recognize the importance of engaging parents in the development of their children to build a strong foundation for future well-being and positive outcomes.
