Early Head Start is a federally funded program whereby family income must conform to established income levels.

### Mission
The mission of the program is to promote healthy prenatal outcomes for pregnant women, to support the development of children from birth to three years of age, and to encourage the family's self-sufficiency through empowerment.

Our program offers home-based services and works collaboratively with families to identify dreams and goals, strengths, and needed services. We partner with parents to monitor infant/toddler growth and development, health, dental, and nutritional needs.

### Participation
Participation and enrollment are voluntary and eligible families residing in Marshall and Starke Counties receive comprehensive infant/toddler services at no charge. The main office for Early Head Start is located at Kaleidoscope Children's Center in Plymouth.
