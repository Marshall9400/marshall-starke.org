### Welcome to Marshall-Starke
Beginning in 1965, Marshall-Starke provided a wide range of rehabilitative services to developmentally disabled individuals. Adult services have further been enhanced through the promotion of community employment and the provision of valuable production alternatives for area business and industry which has resulted in positive and successful relationships in our communities.

From these modest beginnings, Marshall-Starke branched into early childhood education for non-disabled and at-risk children through our Head Start, Early Head Start, and Healthy Families programs.

The programs and services offered through Marshall-Starke and recognized by national accreditations, such as CARF and NAEYC, substantiate what recipients of our services have known for over 40 years that Marshall-Starke promotes a culture of compassion and a commitment to accountability.
