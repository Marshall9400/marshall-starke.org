The Community Crossroads program offers options and choices to program participants. Options
include Community based groups, facility based groups and pre-vocational activities. One of the
challenges we face is matching an individualâ€™s needs and interests to programming. Complicating this
is the wide range of ages we serve. This graph shows the number of individuals served in Community
Crossroads by age.

Community based groups are ideal for those who seek variety and opportunities in the community.
Groups offer volunteer work, recreational activities and social interaction with co-workers as well as
community patrons. This program promotes development of skills and interests as participants gain
greater independence.

Facility based groups focus on training with individuals in personal strengths, needs and interests.
Options include academic instruction, volunteer opportunities, groups that focus on health and well-
being, daily living training, and many other options that promote personal growth and independence.

Pre-vocational activities allow program participants to earn a paycheck. Participants are able to train
in comfortable, familiar surroundings while building skills to gain greater progress towards community
employment.
