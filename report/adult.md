Fiscal year 2013 was a load of fun! We stayed busy throughout the year, filling up our days with fun activities and learning 
opportunities. Some of the highlights of the year are always our parties: we had a great time at the annual fall dance, which 
is always held at the Moose. Our consumers really know how to rock the house! There are many people who help put our parties 
together, consumers, staff and donors. Our Group Community activities typically change in the fall as we start volunteering for 
St. Thomas Head Start, as well as Plymouth Head Start. We also visited the Yellow River Farms for a hayride and choosing pumpkins. 
The fall activities continue as we carve pumpkins and roasted seeds in facility based groups. Other facility based groups include 
such activities as cooking groups, trivia groups, computer classes, academic groups, art groups, board games, and many others 
too numerous to mention. Many consumers will have objectives in the facility based groups they choose, but often consumers will 
participate in groups that are not connected with their objective and learn many skills in groups in addition to their current 
objectives. Opportunities to improve socialization skills are often a part of group facility training. Consumers are constantly 
making new friendships and maintaining old friendships with one another. 

The Christmas Holidays came and went quickly as it often does! Our consumers participate in a variety of Community and Facility 
Groups. We made a few visits out to Hensler's Christmas Tree Farm to sample their hot chocolate and their hospitality!  

The wintery days of January and February were consumed with our regular community outings such as Computer 101 at the Plymouth 
Public Library and water walking at the YMCA in Warsaw to name a few.  

Spring finally arrived and we purchased our annual passes to the State Parks, Price's Pond and Warsaw YMCA, gearing up for camping, 
trail walking, swimming activities, and of course swimming indoors and out. Also, meeting for our first camp-out began commencing 
monthly. If we only knew then what we know now. We attended two Silver Hawks games this spring, which many of our folks enjoyed. 
Also, working our way into warmer weather we enjoyed a couple of group outings to Potawatomi Zoo as well as attending the annual 
Pathfinder's Talent Show. In May, we celebrated again at the Moose Lodge for our annual prom. It was a great success, as usual. 
This sprint we received an award from 1st Source Bank, which we used to purchase a new stove and microwave for our kitchen. We also 
began to implement the new "piece" of our Vertex Intuition Tracking System for goals, streamlining and modernizing our documentation 
for consumer objectives. With the addition of this new program, we are able to print out some really great reports that are very 
useful in consumer meetings. 

As the year moved along, our attendance was up and down, we lost a few and gained a few consumers. Many consumers began receiving 
PAC and Respite in their plans. They have very much enjoyed evening and weekend activities of their choice with some of their 
favorite people: our wonderful staff!

The Community Crossroads program offers options and choices to program participants. Options
include Community based groups, facility based groups and pre-vocational activities. One of the
challenges we face is matching an individual’s needs and interests to programming. Complicating this
is the wide range of ages we serve. This graph shows the number of individuals served in Community
Crossroads by age.

Community based groups are ideal for those who seek variety and opportunities in the community.
Groups offer volunteer work, recreational activities and social interaction with co-workers as well as
community patrons. This program promotes development of skills and interests as participants gain
greater independence.

Facility based groups focus on training with individuals in personal strengths, needs and interests.
Options include academic instruction, volunteer opportunities, groups that focus on health and well-
being, daily living training, and many other options that promote personal growth and independence.

Pre-vocational activities allow program participants to earn a paycheck. Participants are able to train
in comfortable, familiar surroundings while building skills to gain greater progress towards community
employment.

<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>

Supported Living has a lively group of people. They are interested in experiencing a variety of activities
and enjoy each other’s company. They love big parties, such as the B100 Birthday Bash, Maxinkuckee
Lake Festival, Blueberry Festival, North Judson Mint Festival, and Yellow River Festival……party on!

Supported Living consumers particularly enjoy the weekend camping trip at Lake Mississinewa in Peru,
Indiana. Cooking and telling stories around the campfire can’t be beat! Hiking, fishing and rooming
together in cabins with your friends is an event to look forward to each summer.

Our consumers also like to spend time with each other, while forming committees to make party
decisions like what to eat, what music to bring, who will decorate, who will be in charge of games. If we
can’t find an activity, we will make one.

One of our consumers had the opportunity to attend a Notre Dame Football home game this summer.
He said he had wanted to do this his whole life. He is 63 years old and made his dream a reality. What a
great year to attend a Notre Dame game.

<h4 class="subheader" id="industrial">INDUSTRIAL SERVICES</h4>

The focus of programming for individuals enrolled in our Industrial Track is to prepare for community employment.  Individuals work on increasing their productivity, building stamina, developing efficient and effective work methods, and learning the importance of following safety rules.

The work provided in the Industrial Track requires the use of saws, staple guns, and other power machine and tools to produce wooden window blocks for the RV industry, and plywood reels for wire companies.

Because of numerous skill levels, we also try to offer a variety of jobs including, packaging, heat sealing, paper shredding, and labeling.  This line of work is offered both at the Marshall-Starke and Manitou centers.
