<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
In April we hired a new staff. Her title is Residential Habilitation Services (RHS) Evening Supervisor. This supervisor will work some evenings every week to observe at the Residential sites. She will be able to troubleshoot for consumers and Direct Support Professional (DSP) staff. She will also be completing monthly environmental checks for safety, observe medication passes to be sure DSP staff are following procedure, check smoke alarms and address any issues that need attention. RHS Evening Supervisor is also responsible for staffing scheduling shifts and is on call 24/7.

We have had three (3) new consumers join our Supported Living Program in the last year. We are happy to have current openings available.

In August we began transferring RHS consumers from Day Services to our Residential/Supported Living Program. This brought our numbers to 27. Our consumers live in residential sites either alone, sharing a house with peers or in the family home. We offer staff support to meet the consumers needs and budget. We will continue to transfer RHS consumers to this program.

We have also been looking forward to some reorganization in our Supported Living sites. There have been a few consumer changes in the last year and we want to be sure each consumer is living in a home that best suits their needs and also gives them the opportunity to live with different peers if they don't currently have a good match.

We have been struggling to hire and obtain DSP staff for several months. Recently we have hired several new staff and have been able to fill numerous shifts.

We were able to have our Summer Camp again this year. The location was at Tippecanoe State Park. Most of our RHS and Supported Living consumers attend this and spend a couple of nights in the cabins we rent. This is always a highlight of our summer. Other campers attend camps such as Camp Millhouse, ReYoAd and Camp Red Cedar. New friends are made and old relationships rekindled.

We work hard to give our consumers many different opportunities. In the past year, consumers have attended the following events: Turkey Tracks Hunt, Colts Game, Niles Scream Park, Cupcakes and Canvas class, News Boys Concert at Morris Civic, Cavalcade of Wheels, toured a Brewery, Potawatomi Zoo, MSDC/FOP Prom at the Moose, Residential Christmas Dinner Party, attended the Blueberry Festival, Fireman's Festival, Wizard of Oz play, Apple Orchard tour, 42nd Street play at the Century Center, Red Bud Trail event, Mentone Egg Festival, and saw Great White and Dokken Concert.

We look forward to another eventful year!

<h4 class="subheader" id="crossroads">COMMUNITY CROSSROADS</h4>
Community Crossroads program participant numbers have been growing by leaps and bounds! Many consumers have been receiving the FSW as a funding source. which has allowed them to choose MSDC as their provider. Consumers have choices daily that include pre-vocational training and the opportunity to earn a paycheck while learning valuable work skills Consumers may also choose groups in the facility with two trainers that are dedicated to provide facility based groups Classes may be academic in nature or address one of many subjects in our curriculum. Examples could be computer groups, cooking groups, sports activities, exercise or other specific groups to address consumer needs. There are various solicalization groups that occur daily. Consumers also have the option of attending group community outings each day. MSDC provides many hours of volunteer work to area agencies such as Meals on Wheels, Food Pantries, United Way, Older Adult Services, as well as many other non-profit entities. Consumers may also choose meaningful activities such as bingo. bowling, swimming, museum groups. picnics, walking or socialization groups in the community. These groups change every few months to accommodate the changing of seasons Another service we offer to consumers is individual habilitation services Most consumers have some funds in their budgets to receive time spent one-on-one with a trainer. Goals are developed to address a person's needs and the trainer works either in the community or the facility to enhance a consumers abilities in the goal area. A person's day is driven by a consumer's whishes and is decided each morning when they arrive. The daily schedule can have a vanety of serves each day. providing many choices for each consumer, depending on how they wish to spend their day Some consumers have time built Into their budgets to receive PAC or Respite. These sevices are usually utilitied in the evening or on weekends. Consumers recleving these services choose what they would like to do with their trainer. It may be an evening home while parents or guardians have some away time or the consumer may choose to go to a movie and out to eat.

Each year. we offer consumers three extra-curricular activities. In the spring, we have a well attended prom. MSDC collects dress attire for any of those that need clothing to wear. We have been fortunate to have donations of jewelry and prom decorations from area businesses that add to the nuance of the evening Each fall, consumers attend a dance The preparation for these parties are all part of the fun and consumers help each step of the way. For the past two years, we have affered a camping trip to consumers at a very low cost. This year. our trip was held at Tippecanoe State Park where we stayed in "rustic" cabins Our consumers and staff made many wonderful memories, and had a great deal of fun with friends We hope to make this camping trip part of our annual traditions.

<h4 class="subheader" id="industrial">INDUSTRIAL SERVICES</h4>
The Industrial Track is a choice for consumers who wish to have an emphasis on learning work skills. There are job options that give the consumer the opportunity to enhance a large variety of work skills while earning a paycheck. Many of the consumers will choose to spend the majority of their day in this factory setting. Some examples of current sub-contract jobs are grinding bars for bath tub enclosures, using nail and staple guns to assemble wooden blocks for window and door companies, the use of saws for various cut-to-length jobs and work on plywood reels used for wire companies. Other jobs that could be offered would include packaging various items, heat sealing, shredding papers, labeling packages and tagging fire extinguisher cards.
