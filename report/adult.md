<h4 class="subheader" id="crossroads">COMMUNITY CROSSROADS</h4>
The Community Crossroads program offers consumers a variety of home and community based services, affording adults opportunities to live, learn, work and play as a vital part of their own community. Our goal is to keep consumers engaged and involved, giving lifetime learning opportunities.

The day program offers consumers the option to earn a paycheck in our PreVocational area as they perform or train for a variety of jobs, as well as teaching appropriate work behaviors that could translate into a community job for a consumer in the future. Group Community activities present options for volunteerism, exercise, leisure activities and other choices. Those activities are reviewed several times each year, allowing for consumer input. Consumers also have the choice to participate in Group Facility activities. A generous variety of Group Facility classes are offered, allowing consumers to choose activities such as cooking, academics, social, leisure and many other meaningful classes. All of our programs are designed to help individuals live richer, more productive lives.

One of the newer services that MSDC offers is PAC or Respite services to those that are eligible. These services offer families a much needed break to spend some time away from their loved one. These services can be performed in the consumer's home or in the community setting.

We have also begun to offer some Group Community evening activities to those with an abundance of hours that have not been utilized during day program. This idea has been received well and our consumers are happy to have an evening out with peers.

This past year has been a whirlwind of activities. In July, as always, a favorite outing for our consumers is having an invitation to attend the Bremen Firemans Festival to ride carnival rides and eat lunch. We always take full advantage of our local fairs. Some of our Pac and Respite consumers were able to attend the B100 Birthday Party. Our first annual camping trip was a complete success. Consumers had a fantastic time visiting with their peers and enjoying activities that the rest of us often take for granted. Our fall dance commenced in October, and again, a wonderful time was had by all, dancing the night away. Our days were filled with a flurry of activity, with options to participate in a host of community activities, as well as choose classes that are of interest. As we entered November and December, our consumers enjoyed visits to Henslers Tree Farm, gift shopping excursions and of course, the annual Christmas Party, Quentin Flagg entertained us and we enjoyed a lovely meal. January and February were very cold and did affect our attendance as we had many delays and several closures, Ithink by spring, we all had cabin fever! May of each year brings in activities that surround the prom, which is a whole lot of fun for our consumers. I am always impressed how the months fly by at our Center, and I think the old saying time flies when you're having fun, certainly applies here.
