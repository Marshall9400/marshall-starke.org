Fiscal year 2013 was a load of fun! We stayed busy throughout the year, filling up our days with fun activities and learning 
opportunities. Some of the highlights of the year are always our parties: we had a great time at the annual fall dance, which 
is always held at the Moose. Our consumers really know how to rock the house! There are many people who help put our parties 
together, consumers, staff and donors. Our Group Community activities typically change in the fall as we start volunteering for 
St. Thomas Head Start, as well as Plymouth Head Start. We also visited the Yellow River Farms for a hayride and choosing pumpkins. 
The fall activities continue as we carve pumpkins and roasted seeds in facility based groups. Other facility based groups include 
such activities as cooking groups, trivia groups, computer classes, academic groups, art groups, board games, and many others 
too numerous to mention. Many consumers will have objectives in the facility based groups they choose, but often consumers will 
participate in groups that are not connected with their objective and learn many skills in groups in addition to their current 
objectives. Opportunities to improve socialization skills are often a part of group facility training. Consumers are constantly 
making new friendships and maintaining old friendships with one another. 

The Christmas Holidays came and went quickly as it often does! Our consumers participate in a variety of Community and Facility 
Groups. We made a few visits out to Hensler's Christmas Tree Farm to sample their hot chocolate and their hospitality!  

The wintery days of January and February were consumed with our regular community outings such as Computer 101 at the Plymouth 
Public Library and water walking at the YMCA in Warsaw to name a few.  

Spring finally arrived and we purchased our annual passes to the State Parks, Price's Pond and Warsaw YMCA, gearing up for camping, 
trail walking, swimming activities, and of course swimming indoors and out. Also, meeting for our first camp-out began commencing 
monthly. If we only knew then what we know now. We attended two Silver Hawks games this spring, which many of our folks enjoyed. 
Also, working our way into warmer weather we enjoyed a couple of group outings to Potawatomi Zoo as well as attending the annual 
Pathfinder's Talent Show. In May, we celebrated again at the Moose Lodge for our annual prom. It was a great success, as usual. 
This sprint we received an award from 1st Source Bank, which we used to purchase a new stove and microwave for our kitchen. We also 
began to implement the new "piece" of our Vertex Intuition Tracking System for goals, streamlining and modernizing our documentation 
for consumer objectives. With the addition of this new program, we are able to print out some really great reports that are very 
useful in consumer meetings. 

As the year moved along, our attendance was up and down, we lost a few and gained a few consumers. Many consumers began receiving 
PAC and Respite in their plans. They have very much enjoyed evening and weekend activities of their choice with some of their 
favorite people: our wonderful staff! 

<h4 class="subheader" id="supported">SUPPORTED LIVING</h4>
The Supported Living Program added three new consumers. 

Kent came to us in July 2013 and agreed to live in a two bedroom home with another consumer. 

In May 2013, one of the Supported Living landlords began to build a new home to rent to our newest incoming consumers. The home 
is four bedrooms, 2 baths and is handicap accessible for the currrent wheelchari consumer. The new home has an attached garage 
and is in the city limits. The home was to be completed July 2013 but had serveral delays. When the home was completed in 
September, three Casc Managers inspected the home with the consumer guardians and requested some changes. The changes were made 
and we moved in on October 1st, 2013. In this home are two long time consumers and two new consumers, Joe and Andy. The new 
families are very pleased with MSDC services. 

Our current total of consumers for Supported Living is twenty. 

In August 2013, Supported Living attended our Annual Camping trip to Lake Mississinewa in Peru, Indiana. As usual, everyone had 
a memorable time. 

In September our Supported Living consumers attended a camp at Tippecanoe State Park in Winamac. It was unseasonably hot for 
September, but it didn't seem to affect consumers. All had a fun time. 

The highlights of our year are always parties! We went to the B100 Music Festival, the Blueberry Festival, Special Olympics fall 
dance, MSDC fall dance, Harvest Ball, Karaoke at the VFW, train rides in North Judson and the Blue Chip Casino. We attended plays, 
musicals, concerts; went fishing, cooked out, celebrated birthdays and holidays. We ended the year with a Residential Christmas 
party and New Year's Eve party. 

<h4 class="subheader" id="industrial">INDUSTRIAL SERVICES</h4>
The focus of programming for individuals enrolled in our Industrial Track is to prepare for community employment. Individuals work 
on increasing their productivity, building stamina, developing efficient and effective work methods and learning the importance of 
following safety rules. 

The work provided in the Industrial Track requires the use of saws, staple guns and other powered machines and tools to produce 
wooden window blocks for the RV industry and plywood reels for wire companies. 

Because of numerous skills level, we also try to offer a variety of jobs including packaging, head scaling, paper shredding and 
labeling. This line of work is offered both at MSDC and Manitou Center.
