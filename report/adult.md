The Community Crossroads program offers options and choices to program participants. Options
include Community based groups, facility based groups and pre-vocational activities. One of the
challenges we face is matching an individual’s needs and interests to programming. Complicating this
is the wide range of ages we serve. This graph shows the number of individuals served in Community
Crossroads by age.

Community based groups are ideal for those who seek variety and opportunities in the community.
Groups offer volunteer work, recreational activities and social interaction with co-workers as well as
community patrons. This program promotes development of skills and interests as participants gain
greater independence.

Facility based groups focus on training with individuals in personal strengths, needs and interests.
Options include academic instruction, volunteer opportunities, groups that focus on health and well-
being, daily living training, and many other options that promote personal growth and independence.

Pre-vocational activities allow program participants to earn a paycheck. Participants are able to train
in comfortable, familiar surroundings while building skills to gain greater progress towards community
employment.

Supported Living has a lively group of people. They are interested in experiencing a variety of activities
and enjoy each other’s company. They love big parties, such as the B100 Birthday Bash, Maxinkuckee
Lake Festival, Blueberry Festival, North Judson Mint Festival, and Yellow River Festival……party on!

Supported Living consumers particularly enjoy the weekend camping trip at Lake Mississinewa in Peru,
Indiana. Cooking and telling stories around the campfire can’t be beat! Hiking, fishing and rooming
together in cabins with your friends is an event to look forward to each summer.

Our consumers also like to spend time with each other, while forming committees to make party
decisions like what to eat, what music to bring, who will decorate, who will be in charge of games. If we
can’t find an activity, we will make one.

One of our consumers had the opportunity to attend a Notre Dame Football home game this summer.
He said he had wanted to do this his whole life. He is 63 years old and made his dream a reality. What a
great year to attend a Notre Dame game.

<h4 class="subheader" id="industrial">INDUSTRIAL SERVICES</h4>

The focus of programming for individuals enrolled in our Industrial Track is to prepare for community employment.  Individuals work on increasing their productivity, building stamina, developing efficient and effective work methods, and learning the importance of following safety rules.

The work provided in the Industrial Track requires the use of saws, staple guns, and other power machine and tools to produce wooden window blocks for the RV industry, and plywood reels for wire companies.

Because of numerous skill levels, we also try to offer a variety of jobs including, packaging, heat sealing, paper shredding, and labeling.  This line of work is offered both at the Marshall-Starke and Manitou centers.
