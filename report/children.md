## Children's Programs: Highlights and Accomplishments

<h4 class="subheader" id="overview">OVERVIEW</h4>

Last year the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) conducted an onsite monitoring review of our Head Start and Early Head Start programs. The programs serve a total of 222 children residing in Marshall and Starke Counties.

Based on the information gathered during the four day intensive review conducted by a team of six federal compliance monitors, it was determined that the programs were in full compliance with all applicable performance standards, laws, regulations, and policy requirements.

The annual Performance Indicator Report revealed that Marshall-Starke Head Start and Early Head Start exceeded state, regional, and national percentages for numerous performance indicators.

Also in 2012, the Office of Head Start conducted a four day CLASS Review of teacher interactions with students. CLASS is based on developmental theory and research suggesting that interactions between students and teachers are the primary mechanism of student learning and development. The four day CLASS review measured each Head Start teacher’s competency across 124 specific quality indicators.  The program’s CLASS scores exceeded state and national averages.

We are very proud of the services provided by program staff, managers, and administrators who demonstrate a commitment to excellence in all aspects of program operation.
  
The mission of Marshall Starke Head Start and Early Head Start is to prepare children for success in kindergarten. To provide the educational preparation expected by our local school systems and by the Office of Head Start, the programs collect and analyze child outcome data, including progress toward attainment of school readiness goals, four times per year at approximately 12 week intervals.  The data is used to evaluate patterns of performance across the program and to individualize instruction for each student based on the child’s strengths and needs. Outcome data drives instruction and decision making.  A comparative analysis of approximately 17,000 Head Start children reported children enrolled in Marshall Starke Head Start surpassed state and national averages of other Head Start children in the areas of Math, Motor, Language, Science, Social and Emotional, and Creative Arts. Additionally, 100% of the Head Start children eligible for entry into kindergarten achieved the designated school readiness goals.

Because supporting children’s readiness is an ongoing partnership between staff and families the program implemented the Parent, Family, Community Engagement Framework. The Framework is a tool for engaging families and supporting children’s ongoing learning and development. The role of parents in their child’s education should not be understated. Parent engagement is considered by this program to be a school readiness goal and the program successfully achieved 100% parent participation in parent–teacher conferences.

Marshall Starke Early Head Start established school readiness goals that recognized the impact of early experiences on brain development. The EHS school readiness goals recognized how early experiences, particularly the relationships created jointly by baby and parents, shape the foundational learning structures of the brain. The school readiness goals are relationship based and relate to early developmental milestones.  At the program level the last analysis of EHS child outcome data reported that, overall, the enrolled infants and toddlers achieved 90% of the skills and behaviors expected for the 0-3 age range. It is important to note that no child is expected to display all skills for an age range due to individual, environmental, or cultural differences per child.

Marshall Starke Head Start and Early Head Start maintained active wait lists. Not all children on the wait lists were offered enrollment opportunities due to the requirement not to exceed funded enrollment totals. Based on the most recent data from the American Community Survey the estimated number of eligible Head Start and Early Head Start children for this service area is 362.  The programs combined cumulative enrollment was 281children. The percentage of the total number of eligible children served by Marshall Starke Head Start and Early Head Start was seventy eight percent (78%).
