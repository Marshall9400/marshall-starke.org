## Children's Programs: Highlights and Accomplishments

<h4 class="subheader" id="overview">OVERVIEW</h4>
The mission of Marshall-Starke Head Start and Early Head Start is to prepare children for success in kindergarten.  To provide 
the educational preparation expected by our local school systems and by the Office of Head Start, the programs collect and analyze 
child outcome data, including progress toward attainment of school readiness goals, four times per year at approximately 12 week 
intervals. The data is used to evaluate patterns of performance across the program and to individualize instruction for each student 
based on the child's strengths and needs.  Outcome data drives instruction and decision making.  A comparative analysis of 
approximately 17,000 Head Start children reported children enrolled in Marshall-Starke Head Start surpassed state and national 
averages of other Head Start children in the areas of Math, Motor, Language, Science, Social and Emotional, and Creative Arts.  
Additionally, 100% of the Head Start children eligible for entry into kindergarten achieved the designated school readiness goals.

<h4 class="subheader">COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS</h4>
In 2008 the Marshall-Starke Head Start and Early Head Start programs established the Social Services Network in Marshall County. 
The Network is composed of community providers and stakeholders who represent the programs and services utilized by eligible HS and 
EHS families. The Network meets quarterly to share information and coordinate efforts to address the needs of local families. 
The FCS manager facilitates the meetings. The goals are community coordination, advocacy and maximizing of community resources. 
Participating community agencies include but are not limited to: MD Wise, Neighborhood Center, SCAN, Purdue Extension, Single 
Parent PRogram, WIC, Real Services, Riverside School, St. Joseph Regional Medical Center, Plymouth Adult Education, Public Housing 
Authority and Heminger House. 

Now in its 11th year in partnership with North Central Area Vocational Collaborative, Head Start provides field experience for 
junior and senior high school students interested in pursuing a professional career in Early Childhood Education. The course is 
available to students attending 10 area high schools. Over 200 students have completed teh Early Childhood Vocational Education Program. 

The students receive in-class instruction supplemented with direct vocational experiance in Head Start classrooms. Students earn 
nine transferrable college credits the first year and three additional college credits the second year for a total of 12 college 
credits. The college credits are issued by Indiana Ivy Tech College. The majority of students who complete the Early Childhood 
Vocational Education Class pursue post secondary education. This partnership affords the students vocational experience in the 
field of ECE while benefitting HS children with individual attention and interaction. The student volunteer time is also a 
considerable valuable in-kind contribution.
