<h4 class="subheader" id="overview">OVERVIEW</h4>
The Division of Children's Services is composed of three principle programs: Head Start, Early Head Start and Early Childhood Vocational Education.

Our Head Start and Early Head Start programs provide children and their families with education, health. nutrition, and social services. Services are responsive to each child's and family's ethnic. cultural. and linguistic heritage.

Head Start for children 3-5 years of age supports parents as their child's first and most important teachers. Head Start builds relationships with families that support positive parent-child interactions, family well-beineâ€ž and connections to peers and community.

Early Head Start serves pregnant women, infants, and toddlers. Early Head Start helps families care for their infants and toddlers through early, continuous, intensive, and comprehensive services.

Our Head Start (HS) and Early Head Start (EHS) programs may serve a combined total of 222 childern 0-5 years of age inclusive of pregnant women, Our service area is comprised of Marshall and Starke Counties.

Marshall-Starke HS and EHS maintained active waitlists. Unfortunately. not all children on the waitlists were offered enrollment opportunities due to the requirement not to exceed at any one time the funded enrollment of 222 children. Based on the most recent data from the American Community Survey the estimated number of eligible HS and EHS children for our service area is 595. In 2015 the programs' combined cumulative enrollment was 303 children. Fifty-one (51) percent of the total number of eligible children were served by Marshall-Starke HS and EHS. Average daily attendance was eighty-seven (87) percent.

The information gathered during a four day intensive Triennial review conducted in 2012 by a team of six federal compliance monitors, determined the programs to be in full compliance with all applicable performance standards. laws. regulations. and policy requirements.

**Marshall-Starke Early Head Start (EHS)** established school readiness goals that recognize the impact of early experiences on brain development. The EHS school readiness goals acknowledge how early experiences, particularly the relationship created jointly by baby and parents, shape the foundational learning structures of the brain. The school readiness goals are relationship based and relate to early developmental milestones. The last analysis of school readiness data showed the majority of children attained age appropriate expectations.

Because supporting children's readiness is an ongoing partnership between staff and families the program implemented the Parent, Family, Community Engagement Framework. The Framework is a tool for engaging families and supporting children's ongoing learning and development. The role of parents in their child's education should not be understated. Parent engagement is considered by this program to be a school readiness goal. The program successfully achieved 100% parent participation in parent-teacher conferences.

<h4 class="subheader" id="connections">COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS</h4>
The programs rely on the support and participation of community partners. Partnership relationships exist with the following agencies:

* WIC
* Local School Corporations
* Healthy Families
* Neighborhood Center
* Department of Children Services
* Salvation Army
* Care and Share
* Community Services of Starke County
* Love Inc.
* Bella Vita
* J.E.S.S.E.
* North Central Area Vocational Cooperative
* Council on Aging

<h4 class="subheader" id="outcomes">MONITORING OUTCOMES</h4>
In 2015 the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) conducted a Comprehensive Services/School Readiness Review. The programs were found to be in full compliance with all federal regulations and performance standards. The 2015 National CLAS Scores showed our Head Start program to be just shy of the highest 1010 for Emotional Support and Classroom Organization. And just under the median national score for Instructional Support.

All local and state fire, health, and sanitation inspections reported no concerns. The results of the most recent financial audit expressed "an unqualified opinion on all major federal programs" with "no instance of noncompliance material, qualifying MSDC as a low risk auditee."
