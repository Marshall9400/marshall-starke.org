##Presidentâ€™s Message
Fiscal year 2014 was yet another very positive year for Marshall-Starke Development Center. We have continued to improve our financial position while providing a variety of services that continue to receive very favorable marks from consumers, family, and funding sources alike.

I think the highlights of the year, for me, have been some new activities that the consumers have gotten involved in. Probably the biggest new activity was the 2 12 day camping trip to the Tippecanoe State Park. More than 100 of our consumers had a great time, even though the temperatures for September were extremely high. Another activity initiated in 2014 was having a consumer cooking group prepare lunches for our Board of Directors meetings. Each time the group preparing the lunch was brought in to be introduced to the Board. This really turned out to be a great activity enjoyed by the consumers and the Board members.

Also this year, I had consumers accompany me to each of our County Commissioners meetings and do a presentation and an update on the current activities of the Center. I think this was enjoyed greatly by the consumers and the County Commissioners.
One new project we started looking at in 2014 was building a Greenhouse at our PIDCO Drive location. Our vision is to have our consumers grow and sell vegetables. We are in the fund raising stage and hope to have this project completed in FY 2015.
