##President’s Message

Fiscal Year 2012 was an extremely busy, yet very rewarding year for the Marshall-Starke Development
Center.

Our Head Start/Early Head Start programs were scheduled for a triennial review during the first half
of the fiscal year. These reviews are extremely detailed and time consuming. A survey team spends
the better part of a week reviewing our programs against more than 1,700 program standards. I am
extremely proud that, for the first time ever our programs came through this survey without one single
finding. Obviously, all of our Head Start team is to be commended for a job extremely well done.

The second half of our fiscal year, our Adult Programs was scheduled to be surveyed for CARF
Accreditation. We are required to maintain CARF Accreditation for our programs and services to be
funded by the State of Indiana. Again, I am proud to say that the Marshall-Starke Development Center
received a 3-year CARF Accreditation. This is the highest accreditation level available.

Obviously, as I have said before these kinds of results make us very proud. However, more importantly,
we hope that it gives the service recipient’s families, funding sources, referral sources, and the
community a good feeling about what is available here at the Marshall-Starke Development Center.
