##Presidentâ€™s Message
Fiscal year 2013 was yet another good year for the Marshall-Starke Development Center.  We have had continued success with our strategy to improve the over-all financial condition of the organization, and we are confident that progress will continue.  
 
A grant from the Marshall County Community Foundation made it possible for us to make some much needed improvements to our facility. 
We are very appreciative of the support we have received from the Marshall County Community Foundation, and very pleased with the 
building improvements.  However, the success and satisfaction experienced and expressed by those we serve, is for me, the highlight 
of fiscal year 2013. 
 
Our Head Start statistics are well above average across the board.  Our Adult Programs receive very high reviews from consumers, 
families, and referral sources.  These things, I believe, speak volumes about Marshall-Starke Development Center, and I want to 
thank the staff and the Board of Directors for making that possible.
